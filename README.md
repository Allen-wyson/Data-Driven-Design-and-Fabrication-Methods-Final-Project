# EPFL ME-428 FallÂ 2024 Final Project: Strengthâ€‘toâ€‘Weight Optimization of Spiderâ€‘Web Structures


## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This repository hosts the final project for **MEâ€‘428: Advanced Structural Optimization** at EPFL, supervised by Prof. Josieâ€¯Hughes. Inspired by the efficiency of natural spider webs, we developed a dataâ€‘driven workflow to **maximize the strengthâ€‘toâ€‘weight ratio** of bioinspired web geometries.
In simple terms, we taught MATLAB and Python to weave the perfect digital "web" that holds the most weight while using the least materialâ€”much like choosing the fewest silk threads to build the strongest net.

## ðŸš€ Core Workflow

1. **Design Parameter Sampling**: MATLAB draws four discrete variablesâ€”radial/spiral thread counts and radiiâ€”using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).
2. **CAD Automation**: A Python script drives SolidWorks to generate 2D sketches and export STEP geometries for each design.
3. **Finiteâ€‘Element Analysis**: ANSYS Mechanical applies boundary conditions and central loading to compute maximum load capacity for TPU webs.
4. **Bayesian Optimization Loop**: MATLABâ€™s Gaussian Process surrogate and an Expectedâ€¯Improvementâ€¯+ acquisition function balance exploration/exploitation over 20 costly FEA runs.
5. **Convergence**: The pipeline identifies the optimal web: 5 radial, 5 spiral threads, 2.5â€¯mm radial radius, 0.5â€¯mm spiral radiusâ€”yielding an S/W ratio of **13â€¯225**.


## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

* **Optimal Design**: 5 radial & 5 spiral threads, radii 2.5â€¯mm & 0.5â€¯mm
* **Strengthâ€‘toâ€‘Weight**: **13â€¯225** (N/kg)
* **FEA Precision**: Load capacity converges within Â±0.1â€¯MPa over 20 runs
* **Design Trend**: Minimal thread counts and radii yield highest efficiency, mirroring how spiders often use few, thick strands for structural support.
